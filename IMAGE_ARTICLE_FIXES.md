# Image and Article Visibility Fixes - Completed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Gallery Images Not Showing**
- **Problem**: Homepage gallery was using incorrect property names for Supabase data
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated homepage gallery to use `image_url` instead of `src`
  - Updated to use `alt_text` instead of `alt` 
  - Added proper loading states and error handling
  - Used `img.id` as key instead of index

### 2. **Gallery Page Not Dynamic**
- **Problem**: Gallery page was using static image arrays instead of Supabase data
- **Solution**:
  - Converted gallery page to fetch images from Supabase
  - Added loading states and empty state handling
  - Updated all image references to use correct Supabase properties
  - Added proper error handling and fallbacks

### 3. **Articles Not Showing**
- **Problem**: Homepage articles section was showing hardcoded content
- **Solution**:
  - Added dynamic article fetching from Supabase
  - Created loading states for articles
  - Added empty state when no articles exist
  - Display real articles with proper formatting
  - Show article metadata (author, date, category)
  - Link to full articles page

### 4. **Property Name Mismatches**
- **Problem**: Code was using old property names that don't exist in Supabase schema
- **Solution**:
  - Updated all `img.src` references to `img.image_url`
  - Updated all `img.alt` references to `img.alt_text || img.title`
  - Fixed modal image finding logic to use correct properties
  - Added fallbacks for missing data

## Features Added

### **Enhanced User Experience**
1. **Loading States**: Added spinners for both gallery and articles sections
2. **Empty States**: Informative messages when no content is available
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if database queries fail
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Buttons only show when relevant content exists

### **Dynamic Content Display**
1. **Homepage Gallery**: Shows up to 6 most recent images from database
2. **Homepage Articles**: Shows up to 3 most recent published articles
3. **Gallery Page**: Shows all uploaded images with proper pagination
4. **Articles Page**: Already working, now properly linked from homepage

### **Data Consistency**
1. **Unified Schema**: All components now use consistent Supabase data structure
2. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data types
3. **Validation**: Proper checks for required fields and fallbacks

## Database Schema Used

### Gallery Images Table (`gallery_images`)
- `id`: UUID (primary key)
- `title`: Text (image title)
- `description`: Text (image description)
- `image_url`: Text (Supabase storage URL)
- `alt_text`: Text (accessibility text)
- `uploaded_by`: Text (uploader name)
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `featured`: Boolean
- `author_id`: UUID (foreign key)

### Articles Table (`articles`)
- `id`: UUID (primary key)
- `title`: Text (article title)
- `content`: Text (full article content)
- `excerpt`: Text (short summary)
- `author`: Text (author name)
- `category`: Text (article category)
- `featured_image`: Text (optional image URL)
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `updated_at`: Timestamp
- `published`: Boolean
- `author_id`: UUID (foreign key)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Image Upload**: Upload images via admin panel and verify they appear in both homepage and gallery
2. **Test Article Creation**: Create articles via admin panel and verify they appear in both homepage and articles page
3. **Test Filtering**: Verify category filtering works on articles page
4. **Performance Check**: Monitor loading times with larger datasets

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated gallery and articles sections to use Supabase data
2. `src/app/gallery/page.tsx` - Converted from static to dynamic image loading
3. All components now properly handle loading, error, and empty states

The website now properly displays uploaded images and published articles across all pages!
