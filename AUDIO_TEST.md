# Audio System Test Instructions

## 🎵 Testing the Fixed Audio Auto-Play

### Quick Test:
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the website** in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000)

3. **Start the music:**
   - Click the play button in the audio controls (bottom-right corner)
   - You should see "Track 1" or "Track 2" displayed

4. **Test auto-play:**
   - **Option A:** Wait for the track to finish naturally (2-3 minutes)
   - **Option B:** Use browser dev tools to simulate:
     ```javascript
     // Open browser console (F12) and run:
     // This simulates a track ending
     document.querySelector('audio').currentTime = document.querySelector('audio').duration - 1;
     ```

5. **Expected Result:**
   - When track ends → Next track should **automatically start playing**
   - Track name should update (Track 1 → Track 2 or Track 2 → Track 1)
   - Music should continue seamlessly without user interaction

### Manual Skip Test:
- Click the **skip button (⏭️)** next to the play button
- Should advance to next track and continue playing

### Cross-Page Test:
- Start music on home page
- Navigate to Gallery or Articles
- Music should continue playing across all pages

## 🎯 What Was Fixed:

### The Problem:
- When a track finished, the next track didn't auto-play
- User had to manually click play again

### The Solution:
- Modified `GlobalAudioManager.ts` to always continue playing when a track ends naturally
- Added `shouldContinuePlaying=true` parameter to `nextTrack()` method
- Added 100ms delay to ensure proper track loading before playing
- Enhanced error handling for audio events

### Code Changes:
```typescript
// Before (broken):
this.audio.addEventListener('ended', () => {
    this.nextTrack(this.isPlaying); // ❌ Didn't always continue
});

// After (fixed):
this.audio.addEventListener('ended', () => {
    this.nextTrack(true); // ✅ Always continue playing
});
```

## 📱 Favicon Update:
- Created custom GIKI-themed SVG favicon
- Added proper metadata configuration
- Favicon should now display in browser tabs and bookmarks

**Result: Continuous, seamless background music that auto-advances through tracks! 🎉**
