# Article Navigation and Upload Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **"Read Full Article" Button Not Working**

**Problem:** The "Read full article" buttons on both the homepage and articles listing page were not navigating to individual articles.

**Solution:**
- Created a new dynamic route at `/articles/[id]/page.tsx` for individual article pages
- Updated homepage "Read Full Article" links to navigate to `/articles/${article.id}` instead of `/articles`
- Updated articles listing page "Read Full Article" buttons to use `Link` components with proper navigation

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ Created: `src/app/articles/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual article page with full content, author info, related articles, and sharing
- ✅ Modified: `src/app/page.tsx` - Fixed homepage article links to go to individual articles
- ✅ Modified: `src/app/articles/page.tsx` - Changed button to Link component with proper navigation

### 2. **Article Upload Getting Stuck on Loading**

**Problem:** When uploading articles in the admin panel, the form sometimes got stuck in loading state and required a page refresh.

**Solution:**
- Separated `loading` and `submitting` states in ArticleEditor component
- Fixed submit button to use `submitting` state instead of `loading` state
- Ensured proper state management for form submission vs data fetching

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ Modified: `src/app/components/admin/ArticleEditor.tsx` - Fixed submit button to use `submitting` state
